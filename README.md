## Why This Topic Is Interesting
Game development is one of the most complex areas of software engineering because it combines graphics, physics, AI, networking, user interface design, and real-time performance requirements into a single product. The article about *Cyberpunk 2077* is particularly interesting because it shows how even highly experienced studios with large budgets can struggle when technical and production challenges grow too large.

One of the most fascinating aspects discussed in cases like this is how poor code organization and rushed development cycles can lead to unstable systems. Large games often depend on thousands of interconnected systems. When code is poorly structured, overly complex, or written without long-term maintainability in mind, it can create bugs that are extremely difficult to track and fix. Technical debt can build up quickly, especially when developers are forced to prioritize shipping deadlines over proper refactoring and testing.
